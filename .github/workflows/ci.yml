        # REDUCED MATRIX: Keeping private repo during Phase 1-2
        # This minimal configuration validates core functionality while minimizing GitHub Actions costs.
        #
        # CURRENT (Phase 1-2, private repo):
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        python-version: ["3.11"]
        #
        # EXPAND WHEN REPO GOES PUBLIC (Phase 3+):
        # Uncomment the lines below and remove the reduced config above:
        # os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        # python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
        #
        # Benefits of full matrix:
        # - Tests cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
        # - Validates all supported Python versions
        # - No cost for public repos (unlimited Actions minutes)
        #
        # See: docs/ops/ci_expansion_guide.md for detailed instructions
