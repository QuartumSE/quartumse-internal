# Contributing to QuartumSE

## Current Status: Closed R&D Phase

QuartumSE is currently in **Phase 1 (Foundation & R&D)** and is not yet accepting external contributions. All community interactions, even during closed development, are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Timeline for External Contributions

- **Now - Q1 2026 (Phase 1-3):** Closed internal R&D
  - Building core technology
  - Running validation experiments
  - Filing provisional patents
  - Submitting journal papers

- **Q2 2026 (Phase 4):** Early Access for Design Partners
  - Limited onboarding with NDAs
  - Partner-coauthored case studies
  - Feedback integration

- **Q3 2026+ (Phase 5+):** Public Beta & Open Contributions
  - Public repository opens
  - Community contributions accepted
  - Open issue tracker

### Why Closed Development?

We are following a **research-first** strategy:

1. **IP Protection:** We need to secure patent filings before public disclosure of novel techniques (adaptive classical shadows, shadow-VQE integration, etc.)

2. **Publication First:** Academic validation through peer review establishes credibility and ensures technical rigor

3. **Hardware Validation:** Claims about SSR (Shot-Savings Ratio) and RMSE@$ improvements need real hardware validation before external promises

### How to Stay Updated

While we're in closed R&D, you can:

- ⭐ **Star the repo** to get notified when we open
- 📧 **Email us** at contact@quartumse.dev to express interest in Early Access
- 📄 **Watch for preprints** on arXiv (late 2025 / early 2026)

## Future Contribution Guidelines

When we open for contributions (Phase 5+), we will accept:

### Types of Contributions

- 🐛 **Bug reports** via GitHub Issues
- ✨ **Feature requests** (especially domain-specific use cases)
- 📚 **Documentation improvements**
- 🔬 **Experimental results** on new backends or problem instances
- 🧪 **New shadow protocols** (v5+)
- 🔌 **Backend connectors** (IonQ, Rigetti, etc.)

### Code Contributions

All code contributions will require:

1. **Tests:** Unit tests for new features, integration tests for workflows
2. **Documentation:** Docstrings, README updates, example notebooks
3. **Code quality:** Passing black, ruff, mypy checks
4. **License:** All contributions under Apache 2.0

### Handling IBM Quantum credentials locally

When validation tasks require IBM Quantum access, keep credentials local and
out of version control:

- Export the token in your shell with `export QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>`
  before running scripts.
- Optionally store the line `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>` in a personal
  `.env` file (already gitignored) and load it with `source .env` or
  `python -m dotenv run -- <command>`.
- Never paste real tokens into notebooks, commits, or issue comments—use the
  `<YOUR_TOKEN>` placeholder when documenting steps.

### Experiment Contributions

If you run QuartumSE experiments and want to share results:

1. Include full **provenance manifests**
2. Document **backend details** (calibration snapshots)
3. Provide **reproducible notebooks**
4. Report **SSR** and **CI coverage** metrics

We will feature community experiments in our documentation and case studies.

Thank you for your interest in QuartumSE. We look forward to opening the project to the community in 2026!
