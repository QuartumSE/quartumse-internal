# Contributing to QuartumSE

## Current Status: Closed R&D Phase

QuartumSE is currently in **Phase 1 (Foundation & R&D)** and is not yet accepting external contributions.

### Timeline for External Contributions

- **Now - Q1 2026 (Phase 1-3):** Closed internal R&D
  - Building core technology
  - Running validation experiments
  - Filing provisional patents
  - Submitting journal papers

- **Q2 2026 (Phase 4):** Early Access for Design Partners
  - Limited onboarding with NDAs
  - Partner-coauthored case studies
  - Feedback integration

- **Q3 2026+ (Phase 5+):** Public Beta & Open Contributions
  - Public repository opens
  - Community contributions accepted
  - Open issue tracker

### Why Closed Development?

We are following a **research-first** strategy:

1. **IP Protection:** We need to secure patent filings before public disclosure of novel techniques (adaptive classical shadows, shadow-VQE integration, etc.)

2. **Publication First:** Academic validation through peer review establishes credibility and ensures technical rigor

3. **Hardware Validation:** Claims about SSR (Shot-Savings Ratio) and RMSE@$ improvements need real hardware validation before external promises

### How to Stay Updated

While we're in closed R&D, you can:

- ⭐ **Star the repo** to get notified when we open
- 📧 **Email us** at contact@quartumse.dev to express interest in Early Access
- 📄 **Watch for preprints** on arXiv (late 2025 / early 2026)

## Future Contribution Guidelines

When we open for contributions (Phase 5+), we will accept:

### Types of Contributions

- 🐛 **Bug reports** via GitHub Issues
- ✨ **Feature requests** (especially domain-specific use cases)
- 📚 **Documentation improvements**
- 🔬 **Experimental results** on new backends or problem instances
- 🧪 **New shadow protocols** (v5+)
- 🔌 **Backend connectors** (IonQ, Rigetti, etc.)

### Code Contributions

All code contributions will require:

1. **Tests:** Unit tests for new features, integration tests for workflows
2. **Documentation:** Docstrings, README updates, example notebooks
3. **Code quality:** Passing black, ruff, mypy checks
4. **License:** All contributions under Apache 2.0

### Experiment Contributions

If you run QuartumSE experiments and want to share results:

1. Include full **provenance manifests**
2. Document **backend details** (calibration snapshots)
3. Provide **reproducible notebooks**
4. Report **SSR** and **CI coverage** metrics

We will feature community experiments in our documentation and case studies.
