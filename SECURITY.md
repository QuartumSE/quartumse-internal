- A clear description of the issue and potential impact

- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or proof-of-concept code

You can optionally include your PGP key or request a secure channel if additional confidentiality is required.

## Response Expectations

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
- We will provide an initial assessment or request for clarification within **7 business days**.
- We aim to keep you informed about remediation progress and coordinate disclosure timelines before any public release.

Thank you for helping us improve the security of QuartumSE.
