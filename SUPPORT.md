# Support Policy

QuartumSE is an open research project maintained by a small core team. We are
happy to help on a best-effort basis via public channels:

- **GitHub issues:** Bug reports and feature requests. Please search existing
  issues before opening a new one.
- **Discussions board:** Architecture questions, how-to topics, and community
  proposals.
- **Security concerns:** Do not file an issue—see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

We are unable to provide guaranteed response times or priority support. If you
need commercial guarantees, please contact `partnerships@quartumse.dev` to
discuss collaboration options.
