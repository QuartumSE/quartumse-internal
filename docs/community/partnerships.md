# Partnerships & Use Cases

QuartumSE thrives on collaboration. Use this space to highlight partner initiatives, integrations, and success stories.

## Featured Collaborations

- **IBM Quantum:** Joint experiments coordinated through the [IBM Runtime runbook](../ops/runtime_runbook.md) and tracked in the [experiment tracker](../research/experiment-tracker.md).
- **Open-source contributors:** Community-led tooling improvements linked from the [developer documentation](community-hub.md#contribute-documentation).

## Submit a Partnership

1. Draft a short proposal outlining the collaboration scope, expected outcomes, and target timeline.
2. Link supporting experiment plans or research notes from the [research overview](../research/index.md).
3. Announce the partnership in the [community hub](community-hub.md#connect) to gather feedback.

## Showcase a Use Case

Share the impact of QuartumSE in practice:

- Include experiment manifests, reports, or notebooks that demonstrate the workflow.
- Reference relevant tutorials such as the [Quickstart](../tutorials/quickstart.md) or [MEM runbook](../how-to/run-mem-v1.md) to help others reproduce your results.
- Capture lessons learned and route follow-up questions back to the [support resources](community-hub.md#support-resources).

## Keep It Current

Review entries each sprint to ensure they reflect the latest experiment data and strategic priorities outlined in the [roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.md).
