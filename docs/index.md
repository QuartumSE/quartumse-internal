# QuartumSE Documentation

Welcome to the QuartumSE documentation site. This MkDocs-powered hub follows the same narrative as the repository:

1. **Install & verify** the SDK locally.
2. **Run baseline experiments** on Aer or IBM Runtime.
3. **Automate campaigns** with reporting and provenance capture.
4. **Dig into architecture and theory** as you extend the platform.

Use the navigation to jump directly to tutorials, how-to guides, explanation notes, and operational runbooks. Each section is kept intentionally focused so new contributors can follow a linear path from installation to production-grade experiments.

Looking for API details? Head to the [Reference](reference/api/index.md) section. Need the strategic context? See the [Roadmap](strategy/roadmap.md) and [Project Bible](strategy/project_bible.md).
