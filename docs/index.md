# QuartumSE Documentation

Welcome to the QuartumSE documentation hub. The site is organised into four major sections so you can move from first contact to deep experimentation without losing context.

## Home

- Start with the [QuartumSE roadmap](strategy/roadmap.md) to understand the mission and upcoming milestones.
- Browse the [Educational Videos](home/educational-videos.md) page for recordings as they become available.

## Tutorials

- Follow the [Quickstart](tutorials/quickstart.md) and [Hardware Quickstart](tutorials/hardware_quickstart.md) to set up your environment.
- Dive deeper with targeted [how-to guides](how-to/run-st01-ghz.md) covering experiments, reporting, and automation, and the [advanced runbooks](ops/runtime_runbook.md) that support production operations.

## Research

- Keep pace with experiments via the [Research overview](research/index.md) and the [experiment tracker](research/experiment-tracker.md).
- Explore the supporting theory in the [Shadows primer](explanation/shadows-theory.md) and provenance tooling in the [manifest schema guide](explanation/manifest-schema.md).

## Community

- Connect with other contributors through the [community hub](community/community-hub.md).
- Share integrations or success stories in the [partnerships and use cases](community/partnerships.md) area, and consult the [developer docs](explanation/architecture.md) when extending the platform.

Use the navigation tabs to jump directly between these sections. Each area links out to the others so you can, for example, move from a tutorial into the research tracker or from a literature review into community discussions.
