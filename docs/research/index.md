# Research Overview

The QuartumSE research programme coordinates experiment design, execution, and analysis across the project. Use this section to stay aligned on what is running now, which studies are coming next, and where to find background reading.

## Experiment Roadmap

- Review the [QuartumSE roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.md) for phase-by-phase milestones.
- Track execution progress with the [experiment tracker](experiment-tracker.md) and detailed [strategy artifacts](../strategy/phase1_task_checklist.md).

## Experiment Operations

- Consult the [S-T01 GHZ guide](../how-to/run-st01-ghz.md) for the baseline validation path.
- Automate campaigns via the [pipeline how-to](../how-to/run-automated-pipeline.md) and [IBM Runtime runbook](../ops/runtime_runbook.md).

## Theory & Data Models

- Dive into the [Shadows theory primer](../explanation/shadows-theory.md) and the [manifest schema](../explanation/manifest-schema.md) that underpins experiment provenance.
- Compare simulator and hardware reference datasets with the [Phase 1 reference runs playbook](../strategy/phase1_reference_runs.md).

## Literature Library

- Start with the curated [literature list](literature.md) for publications that inform QuartumSE.
- Cross-reference findings with the [Project Bible](../strategy/project_bible.md) to understand how research insights feed into product decisions.

## Collaborate

- Share open questions or propose new studies through the [community hub](../community/community-hub.md).
- Highlight notable results by contributing summaries to the [partnerships and use cases board](../community/partnerships.md).
