# Literature Library

Curated resources that shape QuartumSE experiment design, statistical tooling, and product direction.

## QuartumSE Publications

- **Strategic Review (Oct 30, 2025):** Summarises programme progress and gaps. [Read the full report](../strategy/strategic_review_2025_10_30.md).
- **Project Bible:** Captures the mission, vision, and long-term research agenda. [Consult the source](../strategy/project_bible.md).

## Classical Shadows & Measurement Theory

- Aaronson, S., et al. *Classical Shadows for Quantum Tomography.* (2020). — Motivates the QuartumSE focus on shot-efficient estimation. See how it informs the [Shadows theory guide](../explanation/shadows-theory.md).
- Huang, H.-Y., Kueng, R., & Preskill, J. *Predicting many properties of a quantum system from very few measurements.* (2020). — Provides the theoretical underpinnings for SSR metrics used throughout the [experiment tracker](experiment-tracker.md).

## Error Mitigation & Calibration

- Nation, P. et al. *Scalable Mitiq.* (2023). — Inspires our automated mitigation pipeline; compare with the [MEM v1 runbook](../how-to/run-mem-v1.md).
- Kandala, A. et al. *Error mitigation for short-depth quantum circuits.* (2019). — Guides calibration strategies referenced in the [runtime budgeting checklist](../strategy/runtime_budgeting_checklist.md).

## Workflow Automation & Provenance

- Schelter, S. et al. *Managing ML Pipelines.* (2022). — Reinforces the provenance practices baked into our [automated pipeline guide](../how-to/run-automated-pipeline.md).
- Spinellis, D. *Code Quality: The Open Source Perspective.* (2006). — Influences the quality gates in the [run tests how-to](../how-to/run-tests.md).
