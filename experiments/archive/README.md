# Experiment Archive

This directory contains partially implemented experiment scaffolds that are not
part of the primary validation flow.  They remain available for future work but
are excluded from the default quickstart to keep the repository focused.

Archived prototypes:

- `benchmarking/B_T01_rb_starter.py`
- `chemistry/C_T01_h2_vqe_starter.py`
- `metrology/M_T01_ghz_phase_starter.py`
- `optimization/O_T01_maxcut_starter.py`

Each script still runs but prints TODO notices and placeholder analyses.  Move
experiments back into the top-level `experiments/` tree once they have complete
implementations, automated validation, and documentation.
