experiment: "GHZ-4 Phase-1 Benchmark"
context: >-
  Characterisation run for the 4-qubit GHZ state preparation on the phase-1
  hardware baseline.
aims:
  - Validate calibration stability ahead of Phase-2 scaling experiments.
  - Benchmark v0 and v1 classical shadows estimators against calibration.
success_criteria:
  - Achieve fidelity estimates within 5% of reference simulations.
  - Maintain calibration drift below specified thresholds during the run.
methods:
  - Prepare and measure GHZ-4 circuits across calibration and shadow ensembles.
  - Compare v0 and v1 estimators using matched shadow sizes.
budget:
  total_shots: 5000
