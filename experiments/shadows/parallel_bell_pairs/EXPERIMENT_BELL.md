# Disjoint Bell Pairs Experiment (4 qubits)

**Goal:** Prepare two Bell states (1–2) and (3–4). Estimate XX and ZZ on each pair; run CHSH on one pair.
Compare direct vs. shadows (v0, v1+MEM).

## Metrics & Criteria
- Bell fidelity per pair > 0.9 with MEM.
- CHSH S > 2 with ≥3σ margin.
- CI coverage ~95% where applicable.
