# Notebook Data Directory

This directory stores data generated by Jupyter notebooks during interactive experimentation.

## Purpose

Temporary workspace for notebook-based experiments and analysis. Data here is for development/exploration and should not be considered production data.

## Used By

- Any Jupyter notebook that doesn't use `demo_data/` or `validation_data/`
- Interactive prototyping and debugging sessions

## Directory Structure

Auto-created subdirectories when notebooks run:
```
notebook_data/
├── manifests/     # Notebook experiment manifests
├── shots/         # Notebook shot data (Parquet)
├── reports/       # Notebook-generated reports
└── README.md
```

## Cleanup

Safe to delete at any time:
```bash
rm -rf notebook_data/{manifests,shots,reports}/*
```
